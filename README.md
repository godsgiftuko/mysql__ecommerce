# node.js e-Commerce with MVC pattern

_node.js, JS, mySQL, MVC pattern, Backend_

## üìî Description

In this project, we will develop an e-commerce web application using the MVC pattern, node.js, mysql and related technologies.

On the one hand, users will be able to see and purchase products, while on the other hand employees can perform CRUD operations to manage the product catalogue.

### üìÇ Content

The repository contains the files and folders detailed below:

- **_.env-template_**: a file with the individual user environment variables needed to run this application. Basically only an **API key** is needed, which can be obtained for free by registering in [TMDb](https://www.themoviedb.org).

- **_.gitignore_**: used to indicate the files and folders to be ignored by the version control system _Git_.

- **_README.md_**: this file.

- **_moviedb.js_**: main entry point to the program, with calls (via `require`) to the _npm_ package **_commander_** to generate our command line interface application and to the different implemented commands.

- **_package-lock.json_**: automatically generated file used for any operations where the package manager _npm_ modifies either the _node_modules_ tree (not included in this repository) or the file _package.json_.

- **_package.json_**: contains information about the project (name, version, etc.) including the packages installed as dependencies.
